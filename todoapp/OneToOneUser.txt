## Making one to one relationship for each user 

Import
-First, we need to import the User method in our models.py
	from django.contrib.auth.models import User

-Next, on the model/s you choose to have an individual object relationship for each 
user, add:
	class todo(models.Model):
		user = models.OneToOneField(User, null=True, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
		## the rest of code ##

-After that, you should migrate it. If it can't be done, delete your db and migration folder's files except __init__.py
